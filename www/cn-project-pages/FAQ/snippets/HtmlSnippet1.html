<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />Q: <br />I cannot synch. Looking at the log, I see some &quot;COM Pointer error&quot;. What can it be?<br /><br />A: <br />These errors are coming from the Windows COM module, used by Funambol Client to access Microsoft Outlook application and data.<br />There could be different reasons, as the COM module may be used by other applications too.<br />PLEASE TRY ALL THE FOLLOWING CHECKS BEFORE SENDING AN EMAIL TO FUNAMBOL LISTS.<br /><ul><li>Open Outlook: if a wizard window to configure your profile is prompted, this was the cause for sure. Solution: follow the wizard till the end, then your profile is configured and try again the sync.</li><li>Check if Outlook is correctly working and not stuck. For the latter one, close Outlook and then check if the process &quot;OUTLOOK.EXE&quot; is still running from Windows Task Manager (if yes, you can terminate the process from there).</li><li>If you have an antivirus software installed, disable it and try again. Some antivirus software can recognize the attempt of Funambol plugin to access Outlook application as a malicious action, so they may block it.</li><li>If you have some other Outlook addins installed, disable them (or remove them) and try again. An addin can access Outlook in a (wrong) way that could block other applications to do the same.</li><li>&quot;Google Desktop Search&quot; and &quot;Nokia PC Suite&quot; may conflict with Funambol Outlook Plugin. This doesn't happen for all the users, but you may need to uninstall them and try again.<br />Note: any software accessing Outlook data can be a potential conflicting application, these 2 have just been pointed out by several community members.<br /></li><li>Finally, try to reinstall Microsoft Outlook. It may happen that Outlook has become unstable and thus not perfectly working.</li></ul><p>If ALL the above points didn't help, please send an email to Funambol Users list (users@core.forge.funambol.org) to describe your problem, including:<br />- the exact version of Funambol Outlook Client used<br />- the exact version of both Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Outlook used<br />- a list (if possible) of any software installed on your machine<br />- the full log of Funambol Outlook Client (set the log level to debug)<br />- any other information about your system, that you consider relevant</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
